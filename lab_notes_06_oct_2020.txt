LAB NOTES
06 october 2020

Materials: Solar sensor, light source, current to voltage converter, arduino
Personel: Salvatore Ferrone, Julien Bouet

Objectives:
1. Update program to return angles DONE
2. Do the angles make sense? NO

Notes:
Program returns angles. Angles are not correct. We neeed to verify converter.
We ask yoshimi to look at this. If we are to trouble shoot, we will tabulate data
from the voltmeter and cross compare with converter + arduino.

We can live plot with python, which we will investigate

Trouble shooting converter idea :
Send a known current and measure voltage output, repeat.
Plot the result to have an idea of the conversion curve, which
could be reversed to obtain current input just by measuring voltage output
